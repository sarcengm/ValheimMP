# Known issues 

- Upgrading does not properly update the craft window forcing you to refresh for multiple upgrades.
- Hide weapons hides them completely rather then stashing them on your person
- Raven shows up because tutorial text is still out of sync when it triggers.
- When rocks turn into fragmentable rocks, the first rock is destroyed before it turns into a fragmentable rock making you see a short flicker.
- Sometimes items fail to show the durability properly in the inventory grid

# Continues tweaks

- Tweak all movement related syncing
- Tweak all combat related syncing
- Allow for better interfaces for acting as network library.


---

# Far-fetched features

- Map generation on server side only with clients receiving only what is relevant to them
